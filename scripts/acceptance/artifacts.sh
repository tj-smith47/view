# The binaries an acceptance run measures, guaranteed to be the tree's own.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Every script here drives a compiled binary out of
# `target/`, and a path under `target/` is not evidence of anything on its
# own: it is whatever the last build that touched it left, including a build
# from source that has since been edited away. A run that trusts one is
# capable of reporting a defect that was fixed hours earlier, which is worse
# than a run that fails -- it sends a reviewer looking for a race in code
# that never ran.
#
# So the default path is BUILT here rather than checked for existence, on
# every run, which cargo answers in a fraction of a second when nothing has
# changed. A path the caller pinned is not this script's to build -- it may
# not even come from this tree -- but it is still refused when the tree has
# moved past it, because the same stale artifact produces the same false
# verdict either way.
#
# Callers must define `REPO_ROOT` before sourcing.

# Makes sure `path` is a binary this tree's source produced.
